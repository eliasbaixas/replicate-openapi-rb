        - A generic fallback image.

        The `default_example` object is a [prediction](#predictions.get) created with this model.

        The `latest_version` object is the model's most recently pushed [version](#models.versions.get).

        ```

        As models can take several minutes or more to train, the result will not be available immediately. To get the final result of the training you should either provide a `webhook` HTTPS URL for us to call when the results are ready, or poll the [get a training](#trainings.get) endpoint until it has finished.

        When a training completes, it creates a new [version](https://replicate.com/docs/how-does-replicate-work#terminology) of the model at the specified destination.

        To find some models to train on, check out the [trainable language models collection](https://replicate.com/collections/trainable-language-models).

                  description: |
                    By default, we will send requests to your webhook URL whenever there are new outputs or the prediction has finished. You can change which events trigger webhook requests by specifying `webhook_events_filter` in the prediction request:

                    - `start`: immediately on prediction start
                    - `output`: each time a prediction generates an output (note that predictions can generate multiple outputs)
                    - `logs`: each time log output is generated by a prediction
                    - `completed`: when the prediction reaches a terminal state (succeeded/canceled/failed)

                    For example, if you only wanted requests to be sent at the start and end of the prediction, you would provide:

                    ```json
                    {
                      "version": "5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa",

                    }
                    ```

                    Requests for event types `output` and `logs` will be sent at most once every 500ms. If you request `start` and `completed` webhooks, then they'll always be sent regardless of throttling.

        ```

        `status` will be one of:

        - `starting`: the prediction is starting up. If this status lasts longer than a few seconds, then it's typically because a new worker is being started to run the prediction.
        - `processing`: the `predict()` method of the model is currently running.
        - `succeeded`: the prediction completed successfully.
        - `failed`: the prediction encountered an error during processing.
        - `canceled`: the prediction was canceled by its creator.

        In the case of success, `output` will be an object containing the output of the model. Any files will be represented as HTTPS URLs. You'll need to pass the `Authorization` header to request them.

        In the case of failure, `error` will contain the error encountered during the prediction.

        Terminated predictions (with a status of `succeeded`, `failed`, or `canceled`) will include a `metrics` object with a `predict_time` property showing the amount of CPU or GPU time, in seconds, that the prediction used while running. It won't include time waiting for the prediction to start.

        Input and output (including any files) are automatically deleted after an hour, so you must save a copy of any files in the output if you'd like to continue using them.

        Output files are served by `replicate.delivery` and its subdomains. If you use an allow list of external domains for your assets, add `replicate.delivery` and `*.replicate.delivery` to it.

        `id` will be the unique ID of the training.

        `source` will indicate how the training was created. Possible values are `web` or `api`.

        `status` will be the status of the training. Refer to [get a single training](#trainings.get) for possible values.

        `urls` will be a convenience object that can be used to construct new API requests for the given training.

        `version` will be the unique ID of model version used to create the training.

        Example cURL request:

          https://api.replicate.com/v1/trainings/zz4ibbonubfz7carwiefibzgga
        ```

        The response will be the training object:

        ```json

        }
        ```

        `status` will be one of:

        - `starting`: the training is starting up. If this status lasts longer than a few seconds, then it's typically because a new worker is being started to run the training.
        - `processing`: the `train()` method of the model is currently running.
        - `succeeded`: the training completed successfully.
        - `failed`: the training encountered an error during processing.
        - `canceled`: the training was canceled by its creator.

        In the case of success, `output` will be an object containing the output of the model. Any files will be represented as HTTPS URLs. You'll need to pass the `Authorization` header to request them.

        In the case of failure, `error` will contain the error encountered during the training.

        Terminated trainings (with a status of `succeeded`, `failed`, or `canceled`) will include a `metrics` object with a `predict_time` property showing the amount of CPU or GPU time, in seconds, that the training used while running. It won't include time waiting for the training to start.
